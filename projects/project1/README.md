#Project 1: Alien Typing Simulation

This program is designed to simulate a rocketship typing game where the player attempts to write as many words as possible before 
the rocket hits the top of the screen. When words are correctly typed, the game progresses and displays an alien as a reward. 
When the rocket hits the top of the screen, the game ends and shows your score. Pressing the Enter key restarts the game.
