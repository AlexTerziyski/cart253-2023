# Project 2: Prototype
 For this prototype I just wanted to get the basic shooting, movement, enemy movement, and upgrade/boosts working
 * I also wanted to implement the scoring and health bar/attributes
 
 * Click to consecutively to shoot bullets, the more you shoot the more your healthbar goes down. 
 * If you touch a white square you get the Game Over Screen. 
 * If you hit a white square with your bullets it adds to your score. 
 * If you touch a yellow square it adds to your score.
 * If you touch a red square it adds to your healthbar.

Note* For the sake of testing I used a p5.js 2-d collide library to simplify collision detection:
