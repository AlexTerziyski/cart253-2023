Exercise 2: Dodge Em
 Alexander Terziyski
 
 This exercise dodges your responsibilities!
 The further away the user clicks and drags his ellipse from the responsibilities image, the more green he turns.
 If the user is at a medium distance he turns orange, and if he is dangerously close, he turns red! (this is all done using if and else statements)
 If the user encounters his responsibilities the program stops.
