# Ex 5: Juggle Garden
 Alex Terziyski
 
 This program simulates a juggling game where you must bounce a ball/balls to dodge a Chainsaw!
 The aim is to keep the ball bouncing for as long as possible. 
 If the ball falls to the bottom of the screen and you fail to bounce it, you get 'Ending 1'. 
 If the ball hits the Chainsaw, you get 'Ending 2'. 
 If you want to make it more difficult for yourself, you may click anywhere on the screen to add more balls!
 
 The simulation starts right away with 1 ball automatically spawning! Have fun!
