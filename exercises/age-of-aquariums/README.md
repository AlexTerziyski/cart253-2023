# E4: Age of Aquariums
 * Alex Terziyski
 * This program has a user-controlled "fish" that is controlled with W,A,S,D. 
 * The user's fish can eat the wild fish. 
 * The wild fish come in different colors (parameter) and will never touch eachother! (property)
 * If you eat 5 fish, you get the Nom Nom Ending!
 * If 10 seconds pass and you don't eat any fish, you get a Failure ending (sadface)
 * Players can also click to spawn more fish!
