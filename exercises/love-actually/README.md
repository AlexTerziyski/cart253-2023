# Ex 3: Love, actually

 This program is all about being traumatized! There are 5 states: title, simulation, trauma, despair, and party. The user controls circle1 using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right). The further away circle1 is from circle2, the more aggresively circle2 vibrates and is traumatized. The closer they are, the less circle2 vibrates. If both circles touch, they are traumatized! If both leave the screen, they are stuck in a pit of despair! If the user presses Up, Down, Left, and Right (Arrow Keys) consecutively you enter the party easter egg state! Click the screen at the start to enter the simulation state and begin the program.
