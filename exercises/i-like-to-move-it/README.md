EXERCISE 1: I-LIKE-TO-MOVE-IT
Alex Terziyski

Draws 3 different shapes (circle, square, and a triangle) that all interact in different ways
 * The square randomizes is width, height, and color, while moving to the right until it goes off the screen
 * The circle's diameter fluctates depending on the position of the mouse on the Y axis using map(), moving downward
 * the triangle moves to the left until it is stopped by constrain() at the border of the canvas
 * the background changes color depending on the position of your mouse on the screen (X and Y axis)
